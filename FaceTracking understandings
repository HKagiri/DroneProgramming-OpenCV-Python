Tracking the face
    Need Pitch movements (fb)
          Yaw rotation  (yv)

    fb:
    Object or face looking small  == move forward (far from object)
    Object or face looking big  == move back (close to object)

    Limit of too close and too far
            eg  btwn  6200 - 6800  # tested values
            width * height  == area in pixels
            counter the movement to ensure there is a green zone (defined by area)

    yv:
    Rotate the drone to have the object at the centre
    Overshooting is present
    Reduce the speed as we reach our destination eg start from 20 - 10 - 5 -0 cm/s (PID)   Propotion Integral Derivative
