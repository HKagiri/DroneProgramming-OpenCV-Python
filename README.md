# DroneProgramming using OpenCV and Python
 
### Understood the basics of a drone including the components and how the drone flies. 
### Then looked at the installations and the basic movements along with image capture. 
* From there I accomplished the following mini projects:
  - Creating Keyboard controls to fly the drone
  - Performing Surveillance by creating an image capture.
  - Face tracking.
  - Line following using open CV. 
  
* Libraries installed to make it work:

  - djitello - main library that allows one to call functions related to drone perfomance and actions.
  - pygame - used to accept the keyboard inputs.

### Very soon will be attempting to do Object Detection
